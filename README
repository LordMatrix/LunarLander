LUNAR CRASHER
------------------

In this game, you must land a lunar module on the surface of an abrupt terrain. 
The designated landing areas are flat surfaces with a number on them. You must land on top of the number or to its right.
Coming in too fast, rotated on an excessive angle, or landing on any other area will cause your ship to crash.
Once you have landed successfully, you can explore the area on a bouncy lunar rover. You cannot control the rover while it is on the air.
Alternatively, you can just reach high speed and crash the module into oblivion.

Controls:
    On ship  ->  Left  - Rotate ship counterclockwise
                 Right - Rotate ship clockwise
                 Up    - Thrust ship forward
    
    On rover -> Left   - Move left
                Right  - Move Right


In addition to the required features, this game also includes the following:

- Procedurally generated terrain using Perlin noise.
- Infinitely scrollable terrain.
- A bouncy lunar rover to explore the dark side of the moon.
- A limited fuel level
- The fuel counts towards the total weight. The less the fuel, the less resistance to thrusting.

- Collisions are processed by pairs, so every possible pair of cpBodies has its own callback function.
